M-Zoom (Multidimensional Zoom)
========================
**M-Zoom (Multidimensional Zoom)** is an algorithm for detecting dense blocks in tensors.
**M-Zoom** has the following properties:
 * *scalable*: scales almost linearly with all input factors
 * *provably accurate*: provides high accuracy in real data as well as theoretical guarantees
 * *flexible*: supports high-order tensors, various density measures, multi-block detection, and size bounds
