M-Zoom (Multidimensional Zoom) and M-Biz (Multidimensional Bi-directional Zoom) are algorithms for detecting dense blocks in tensors. 
They have the following properties: 
- Scalable: scales almost linearly with all input factors
- Provably accurate: provides high accuracy in real data as well as theoretical guarantees
- Flexible: supports high-order tensors, various density measures, multi-block detection, and size bounds.
