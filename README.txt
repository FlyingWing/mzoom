M-Zoom (Multidimensional Zoom) is an algorithm for detecting dense blocks.
M-Zoom has the following properties:
- scalable: scales almost linearly with all input factors
- provably accurate: provides high accuracy in real data as well as theoretical guarantees
- flexible: supports high-order tensors, various density measures, multi-block detection, and size bounds
